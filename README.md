```
yarn install
```

```
mkdir data && mkdir data/db

Make sure you have Mongodb installed, then

```
yarn db
```

This will trigger the first build and then watch server / client whenever changes are made
```
yarn watch
```

This will launch the express server & reload it with nodemon whenever webpack triggers changes to the server file
```
yarn start
```
